## POST ?script=1

Execute a series of changes in a single changeset. Each change has an action ('select', 'create', 'update', 'delete' or 'query_ids'). Each change can reference the values of a previous change (e.g. in the example below, the 1st value of the array `tags` will get the `id` of the result of the 1st change).

The result of a 'select', 'create' or 'update' changeÂ will always be the full object. A 'query_ids' statement requires a table and optionally filter and sort.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "create",
    "table": "x",
    "data": {
      "foo": "bar"

    "action": "update",
    "table": "x",
    "id": "y",
    "data": {
      "bar": "foo"
    },
    "references": {

    }
  },
  {
